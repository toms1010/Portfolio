I recently participated in the Free Coding Bootcamp Basic Web Development Workshop held on January 25, 2025. During this workshop, I gained foundational knowledge and hands-on experience in web development, focusing on key areas such as HTML, CSS, and basic coding techniques. By actively engaging in the activities, I was able to better understand how to build and style websites. This experience marked an important step in my journey toward becoming a skilled web developer. The skills I acquired have laid a strong foundation for more advanced learning in both front-end and back-end development, and they reflect my ongoing commitment to growing in the field of computer engineering.
